# fishery-models-tutorial

This is an implementation of fisheries stock assessment models, written in Python for learning, research and reproducibility.

Each model is built from first principles, with clear links between biological assumptions, equations, and code.

Each folder contains:
- Clean, commented, reusable Python functions
- A demo notebook showcasing the model usage

My goal is to guide the curious practitioner and new modellers through the implementation of standard fishery models from scratch.
